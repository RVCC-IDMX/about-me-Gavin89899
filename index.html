                <p>Hello, my name is Gavin Corley I am a student at Raritan Valley Community College studying Information Technology. I plan to eventually move on and transfer to a 4-year university and continue my education on Information Technology. I am not entirely sure what I want to do when I graduate but I am leaning towards something in tech. I do not know if I am more of a programmer or a hands-on build computers type of guy. I find it kind of ironic that my entire life I have been saying that I don‚Äôt want an office job and to be stuck in a cubicle, and while that may not be the case in the new world of work from home, I am still choosing a career that is known for long sedentary days. I am an Eagle Scout which has helped me see life different and helped me learn how to be a leader. In this world and this line of work it is important to have a voice and be able to step up and lead if the opportunity presents itself. Somedays I may be working with myself and somedays I may be working with others, so I need to be able to work well with others or be productive on my own. I am excited for what the future brings me.</p>

            <p>There is lots of cool things that you can do with HTML and CSS. One thing that I find very fascinating is being able to embed a google map into a website. Using an iframe you can insert code directly into your HTML document to pull straight from google maps. There can be many reasons to embed a map into your website. Some reasons could include to show the location of your business, if you wanted to highlight a certain area, or if you wanted to point to a particular location such as a store. Embedding the google map into your website is a simple straight forward. First you must search up your address or location that you want displayed. Once you have found your desired map piece to embed you need to click on share. In the share menu there is an option to embed, you need to click that option. After you click on the embed option it will bring up a dialog box that shows the HTML code for the iframe. Copy and paste the code into your HTML document. Once you have pasted the code into your own code this will give you the basic outline of the map. If you wanted to edit how it looks you will have to do that on your own. Now that the map is embedded into your website it will show an interactive map that will move around. If you have searched up your location, then it will highlight the address and show quick information on the place. This can be helpful in aiding people to find your establishment or somewhere you are recommending such as a restaurant. Here is an example:</p><br>
            <section id="map">    
                <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3028.8174536158135!2d-74.69077554855191!3d40.61185105157098!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89c3937dc5acab1f%3A0x15e7f0de30681faa!2sRaritan%20Valley%20Community%20College!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1651628203107!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="1200" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
            </section>
            <p>Learning how to embed things such as google maps, or a YouTube video are very important for a web developer. These features allow for more customization and usability to your website. Adding features such as these and links to your website can help the people that use the website be able to access everything that they need right from the site. It saves people time not having to go out and look up the information on their own.  Your job as a website creator is to make the experience for the user as simple and intuitive as possible. Think about it, if you visited a website and had to click out and lookup information every time it mentioned something then it isn‚Äôt a very effective website. The point of using a website is for accessibility and to act as a hub of information whether it be an article or a shopping page. All websites have some form of HTML or CSS that allows the user to interact with the information. It could be something as simple as a link to another website. These simple little tools are what make the connection between creator and user so special. The creator helps to point the users in the right direction to do what they set out to do. Hopefully after reading this article you will have a better understanding of how to embed a google map into your website.</p>
