## Hello my name is ***Gavin Corley*** and this is my About Me website:

I have learned a lot while working on this project and while it hasn't always been easy, it was a very fun and helpful journey. It was a bumpy ride to get to where the site is now, working relentlessly to achieve an ideal mix of look and functionality. I ran into my fair share of bugs and misspells that tried to derail my project. you would think that forgetting something as small as a period wouldn't be a big problem, but boy was I wrong. It was very helpful to encounter these problems because it helped me learn how to troubleshoot my own problems as the professor will not always be there to guide me. I learned lots of useful techniques while building my website such as how to link CSS into an HTML document, use hover effects, and even how to embed a YouTube video. Even before I learned how to do all of that I had to learn the basics of HTML such as how to use main or header these simple tags are what help put together the foundation of my website. Building a website is an intricate and lengthy process but the end result is worth all the countless hours and confused looks.
